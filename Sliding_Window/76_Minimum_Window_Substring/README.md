**Topic:** Sliding Window, HashMap  
**Difficulty:** Hard  

---

## Problem
Given two strings `s` and `t`, find the minimum window substring of `s`
that contains all characters of `t` including frequency.

---

##  Approach
- Sliding Window technique
- HashMap to store character frequency
- Expand window until all chars are matched
- Shrink window to minimize length

---

##  Complexity
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(k)
